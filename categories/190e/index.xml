    <description><![CDATA[My First Hugo Post!
I&rsquo;m a rock believer You start to crawl until you walk You make a scream and learn to talk You discover life on every day From the first day you were born You walked a lifeline of your own And if you always keep the faith No one can take your dreams away In the ruins of their souls You saw the beauty of it all Simply a generation change How our fathers came to steal But we came back to make you feel Our love in every song we play Scream for me, screamer I&rsquo;m a rock believer like you Just like you Come on, scream for me, screamer I&rsquo;m a rock believer like you Just like you We go from here to everywhere So many moments that we share All boarded up, we give and take Love came to me so many ways No matter what some haters say No one can take our dreams away Scream for me, screamer I&rsquo;m a rock believer like you Just like you Come on, scream for me, screamer I&rsquo;m a rock believer like you Just like you]]></description>
